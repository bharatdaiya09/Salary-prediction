# Salary Prediction Model

## Overview
This project involves building a salary prediction model based on a dataset of employee information. The goal is to create a regression model that can predict employee salaries based on various features such as age, years of experience, job title, education level, gender, race, and country.

The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project, "Salary1.csv," contains employee information, including features like age, years of experience, job title, education level, gender, race, and country.

## Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values.
- Grouping similar job titles and education levels.
- Encoding categorical features.
- Normalizing numerical features.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
- Visualizations to understand data distributions and relationships between features and salary.
- Identification of key factors influencing salary.

## Feature Engineering
- Creation of new features or transformations to potentially improve model performance.

## Model Training
- The project uses a Random Forest Regressor for salary prediction.
- Train-test split to assess model performance.

## Hyperparameter Tuning
- GridSearchCV for finding the best hyperparameters for the Random Forest Regressor.

## Model Evaluation
- Assessment of model accuracy using metrics such as R-squared, Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error, and Root Mean Squared Error.

## Results
- Interpretation of model performance and insights gained from feature importance analysis.
- Suggestions for further improvements.

## Further Improvements
- Fine-tuning hyperparameters for better accuracy.
- Feature selection and engineering.
- Trying different regression models or ensemble methods.
- Implementing cross-validation for robustness.
- Collecting more data for improved predictions.
- Applying regularization techniques.

## Deployment
- Preparing the model for deployment in a production environment (not included in this repository).
